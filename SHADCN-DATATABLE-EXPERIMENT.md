# Shadcn Data-Table Experiment

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a temporary experimental implementation of shadcn's data-table component for the Procurements listing page.

## 📋 What Was Created

1. **`Index-Original-Backup.tsx`** - Backup of your original implementation
2. **`Index-Shadcn-DataTable.tsx`** - New shadcn data-table version

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-table
```

### Step 2: Activate the Shadcn Version

```bash
cd resources/js/Pages/Procurements
mv Index.tsx Index-Current.tsx
mv Index-Shadcn-DataTable.tsx Index.tsx
```

### Step 3: Build and Test

```bash
npm run build
# OR for development with hot reload:
npm run dev
```

Then visit `/procurements` in your browser to see the new data-table in action!

## 🔄 How to Revert (If You Don't Like It)

Easy rollback in one command:

```bash
cd resources/js/Pages/Procurements
mv Index.tsx Index-Shadcn-DataTable.tsx
mv Index-Original-Backup.tsx Index.tsx
npm run build
```

## ✨ What's Different

### Shadcn Data-Table Features:

1. **Better Sorting UI** - Arrow icons that indicate sort direction
2. **Cleaner Column Definitions** - More maintainable code structure
3. **Professional Styling** - Shadcn's design system (hover states, borders, spacing)
4. **TanStack Table Power** - Industry-standard table library
5. **Enhanced Pagination** - Prev/Next buttons with better UX
6. **Row Hover Effects** - Better visual feedback

### What Stays the Same:

- All filters work identically
- Same RBAC enforcement
- Same actions (View/Edit/Archive)
- Same pagination from Laravel
- Same currency formatting
- Same status badges

## 🎨 Visual Differences

### Header
- Sortable columns now show arrow icons
- Hover states are more subtle and professional

### Table Rows
- Clean border separators
- Hover effect highlights entire row
- Better spacing and alignment

### Pagination
- Previous/Next buttons with chevron icons
- Better disabled state styling
- Shows result count (e.g., "Showing 1 to 15 of 42 results")

## 📊 Performance

The shadcn data-table uses TanStack Table which is:
- ✅ Highly optimized for large datasets
- ✅ Supports virtualization (if needed later)
- ✅ Tree-shakeable (only bundles what you use)
- ✅ Well-tested and maintained

## 🔧 Next Steps (If You Like It)

If you decide to keep the shadcn version:

1. Delete the backup files
2. Apply the same pattern to other list pages (if desired):
   - Purchase Requests Index
   - Purchase Orders Index
   - Vouchers Index (if you create one)
   - Admin list pages (Offices, Particulars, etc.)

## 🤔 Decision Points

**Keep Shadcn If You Like:**
- More professional look and feel
- Better maintainability with column definitions
- Industry-standard table library
- Future-proof for advanced features (column visibility, row selection, etc.)

**Revert to Original If:**
- You prefer the simpler custom implementation
- Don't want the extra dependency
- Current table works perfectly for your needs
- Prefer minimal bundle size

## 💡 Notes

- The implementation is **fully functional** with all existing features
- No backend changes required
- TypeScript types are properly maintained
- Follows your existing coding standards
- Uses lucide-react icons (already in your stack)
