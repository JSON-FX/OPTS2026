# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review the PRD for OPTS (Online Procurement Tracking System) and create comprehensive UX/UI designs. Focus on the delivery-tracking-inspired experience with clear status visibility, timeline visualizations, and progressive disclosure patterns. Design all 22 core screens identified in the PRD with consistent Shadcn/UI component usage, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, and responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Pay special attention to the dashboard layout, transaction timeline visualizations, and workflow endorsement flows.

## Architect Prompt

Please create the technical architecture document for OPTS based on this PRD. Using Laravel 12.x with React 19 via Inertia.js, TypeScript, and MySQL 8.0+, design the complete database schema expanding from the conceptual model provided, define Eloquent model relationships including polymorphic Transaction implementations, architect the reference number generation service with atomic sequence management, design the workflow engine with state machine patterns, create the ETA calculation service architecture, define TypeScript interfaces for all domain entities, establish Inertia component architecture patterns, and provide detailed implementation guidance for each epic's technical requirements. Ensure the architecture supports 200 concurrent users, 100k transactions, and maintains performance targets specified in NFR5.
