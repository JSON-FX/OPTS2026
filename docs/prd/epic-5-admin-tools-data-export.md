# Epic 5: Admin Tools & Data Export

**Epic Goal:**

Implement administrative override capabilities enabling administrators to correct misrouted transactions through Bypass Endorsement functionality with required justification and audit logging. Build page access management providing fine-grained control over role-to-page permissions through an intuitive permission matrix interface. Develop the announcement system allowing administrators to create and manage system-wide announcements with three severity levels (Normal, Advisory, Emergency) displayed as persistent banners with bell icon notifications. Implement comprehensive data export functionality supporting CSV and JSON formats with extensive filtering options by date range, office, status, category, fund type, and supplier for compliance reporting and external analysis. Enhance audit trail reporting with exportable logs capturing all system events, state changes, and administrative actions. This epic delivers administrative control tools, compliance reporting capabilities, and system-wide communication channels essential for production operations. By epic completion, administrators have full control over system configuration, user communications, misroute corrections, and comprehensive data export capabilities for auditing and reporting requirements.
