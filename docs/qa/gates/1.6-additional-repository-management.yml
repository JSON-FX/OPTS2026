nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RBAC properly enforced via middleware. All routes require authentication and Administrator role. Form Request validation prevents SQL injection. No XSS vulnerabilities. Comprehensive security tests validate 403 responses for non-admin users.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Pagination at 50 records implemented. Database indexes on is_active and unique constraints. Client-side filtering appropriate for dataset size. No N+1 queries. Performance tests validate pagination behavior.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive test coverage ensures correctness. Soft delete prevents data loss. Flash messages provide user feedback. Error handling via Form Request validation. 100% test pass rate.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent pattern consistency across all three repositories. Self-documenting code structure. Comprehensive test suite aids future changes. Follows established Laravel/React conventions.'

architectural_notes:
  - Pattern consistency across all three repositories mirrors Stories 1.4 and 1.5
  - Field name discrepancy (Epic AC "name" vs model "description") properly documented and resolved
  - Controllers follow thin wrapper pattern (no business logic)
  - Client-side operations (search/filter/sort) appropriate for dataset size
  - TypeScript interfaces properly typed with nullable fields

recommendations:
  immediate: [] # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: 'Implement AC#11 referential integrity warnings'
      refs: ['Story notes indicate Epic 2+ consideration']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Currently simple delete confirmation. Future enhancement to check relationships before deletion.'
    - action: 'Add browser E2E tests when full workflow available'
      refs: ['Epic 2+ consideration']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Feature tests provide good coverage. E2E tests valuable for integrated workflows.'
    - action: 'Monitor client-side filtering performance'
      refs: ['Index pages use client-side filtering']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Current approach appropriate for <1000 records. May need server-side filtering if datasets grow.'

field_name_resolution:
  issue: 'Epic ACs specified "name" field for Particular/ActionTaken but existing models use "description"'
  resolution: 'Implementation correctly followed existing database schema from Story 1.2 for consistency'
  impact: 'None - Properly documented in Dev Notes, recommended for Product Owner review'
  status: 'RESOLVED'

pattern_validation:
  controllers: 'PASS - All three controllers follow identical resource pattern'
  form_requests: 'PASS - Proper unique validation with update exclusions'
  routes: 'PASS - All within Administrator middleware group with correct naming'
  react_pages: 'PASS - Index/Create/Edit structure consistent across all repositories'
  tests: 'PASS - Comprehensive RBAC, CRUD, edge case coverage'
  typescript: 'PASS - Proper interfaces with nullable fields, successful compilation'
