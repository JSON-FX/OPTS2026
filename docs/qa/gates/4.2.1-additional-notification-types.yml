  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Server-side event/listener pattern with no user input in notification content. NotificationController validates user ownership."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Overdue command uses eager-loading and filtered queries. Consider composite index for 10k+ scale."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Events dispatched outside DB transactions ensuring data consistency. Idempotent overdue check with 24h window. Null-safe navigation throughout."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows existing OutOfWorkflowNotification pattern exactly. Consistent code style (Pint-formatted, strict types). Generic controller/middleware automatically supports new types."
