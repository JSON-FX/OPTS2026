# Transaction Dependencies & Business Rule Validation
# Comprehensive review by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.4"
story_title: "Transaction Dependencies & Business Rule Validation"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Exceptional implementation quality. All 17 acceptance criteria fully met with comprehensive test coverage (24 tests: 16 unit + 8 feature). Clean service layer design, Laravel best practices, RBAC enforcement, and type safety throughout. No security concerns, optimal performance, zero technical debt."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RBAC properly enforced via Form Request authorize() methods. Input validation (exists check) before business rule evaluation. Null safety in validation rules. No SQL injection risk (Eloquent ORM). No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient implementation using Eloquent exists() queries (single COUNT per check). Service registered as singleton. No N+1 issues (hasOneThrough relationships). Soft delete scoping automatic via Eloquent."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in validation rules. Null procurement checks. Exact error message matching per AC requirements. Edge cases tested (soft deletes, multiple procurements)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean service layer with focused methods. Proper dependency injection. Comprehensive PHPDoc and JSDoc comments. All files follow PSR-12. TypeScript interface for frontend type safety. Strict typing enforced."

testability_assessment:
  controllability: "Excellent - Test helpers create procurements and transactions with full control over state"
  observability: "Excellent - Boolean return values and validation error messages easily asserted"
  debuggability: "Excellent - Clear method names, simple logic, comprehensive test coverage"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Service layer: 6 focused methods, single responsibility"
  - "Custom ValidationRule implementation (Laravel 11+) with dependency injection"
  - "Form Requests combine RBAC authorization + custom validation rules"
  - "Unit tests cover all methods + edge cases (soft deletes, null checks)"
  - "Feature tests validate exact error messages per AC7-8 requirements"
  - "TypeScript interface with JSDoc for frontend integration"
  - "Strict typing (declare(strict_types=1)) in all new PHP files"
  - "Singleton service registration for proper lifecycle management"
  - "Soft-delete awareness via Eloquent's built-in scoping"

architecture_alignment:
  service_layer: "Follows backend-architecture.md: Services in app/Services/, registered in AppServiceProvider"
  validation: "Follows coding-standards.md: Custom rules in app/Rules/, implement ValidationRule interface"
  form_requests: "Follows backend-architecture.md: Form Requests extend FormRequest with authorize() + rules()"
  testing: "Follows testing-strategy.md: Unit tests in tests/Unit/Services/, Feature tests in tests/Feature/"
  project_structure: "Perfect alignment with unified-project-structure.md"
