# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RBAC implementation secure. Role middleware properly enforced. Self-deletion prevented. Password hashing via Laravel casts. No SQL injection risks (Eloquent used). Authorization checked on all routes.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Eager loading implemented (with roles, office). Pagination at 50 records. Indexed queries on roles/offices. No N+1 query issues detected.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Form validation comprehensive (StoreUserRequest, UpdateUserRequest). Self-deletion prevention. Soft deletes not implemented but explicit delete() used. Error handling via redirects with messages.'
