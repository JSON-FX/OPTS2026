nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RBAC properly enforced via Spatie middleware. Form Request validation prevents injection. Unique constraints and soft deletes maintain data integrity. Minor recommendation: consider authorization policies for fine-grained control.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Pagination at 50 records, eager loading prevents N+1 queries, client-side filtering reduces server load, proper indexing on unique fields.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive validation, user impact warnings, graceful error handling, 100% test pass rate (46/46 tests).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean controller design, separated validation logic, TypeScript type safety, consistent naming, proper relationships.'
