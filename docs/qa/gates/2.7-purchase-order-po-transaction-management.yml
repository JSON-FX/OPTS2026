strengths:
  - 'Excellent controller refactoring from Story 2.1 to 2.6/2.7 schema'
  - 'Strong business rule implementation with proper dependency validation'
  - 'Supplier address snapshot pattern correctly implements immutable audit trail'
  - 'Comprehensive form validation with decimal precision and uniqueness checks'
  - 'Proper RBAC enforcement at middleware and form request levels'
  - 'Clean architecture with thin controllers and service layer separation'

weaknesses:
  - 'Model schema not updated during initial dev (required QA intervention)'
  - 'Incorrect eager loading relationship path (required QA intervention)'
  - 'Test assertions don''t match controller response patterns (3 tests)'
  - 'Using deprecated PHPUnit doc-comment syntax'

lessons_learned:
  - 'When refactoring schema, verify ALL related files (model, controller, migration, factory, tests)'
  - 'Verify eager loading paths match actual model relationships before deployment'
  - 'Controller response patterns (redirect vs JSON) should match test expectations'
  - 'Model fillable/casts are critical - mismatch causes silent failures'
  - 'Run full test suite including manual page access testing before marking story done'

next_story_recommendations:
  - 'Create Story 2.7.1: Fix PurchaseOrder Test Assertions (15 min task)'
  - 'Include model schema verification in dev checklist'
  - 'Add explicit test for model fillable/casts matching migration schema'
