# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RBAC properly enforced via middleware and Form Requests. Mass assignment protection via $fillable. Soft deletes prevent data loss. CSRF protection inherited from Breeze. No sensitive data exposure in frontend props.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Eager loading with with() prevents N+1 queries (controller lines 36-40, 128-136, 148). Pagination at 50 items per page. Indexed foreign keys. Proper query scoping with filters.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive Form Request validation. Soft delete safety. Transaction-aware field locking prevents data integrity issues (controller lines 166-171).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with thin controllers. Type-safe TypeScript frontend. All code complies with PSR-12 after refactoring. Strict typing enforced across all new PHP files.'
