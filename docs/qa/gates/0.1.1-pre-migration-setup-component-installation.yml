gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate set to PASS with team confirmation (2024-11-04):

  1. AC2 CLARIFIED: Team accepted on-demand component generation approach
     - All 17 Radix UI dependencies installed and ready
     - Components generated as needed in future stories (pragmatic, efficient)
     - Avoids upfront effort for potentially unused components

  2. AC4 DEFERRED: Team confirmed baseline screenshot deferral acceptable
     - Can be addressed in dedicated story or integrated into Story 0.1.2
     - Not blocking migration progress
     - Visual regression testing starts after component migrations begin

  3. QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
     - Configuration complete and excellent (CSS, Tailwind, components.json)
     - Documentation exceptional (DataTable guide + component mapping)
     - Build verification passing (TypeScript + production build)
     - Technical foundation solid for entire Epic 0.1

  This is a successful foundation story with team-approved pragmatic decisions.
