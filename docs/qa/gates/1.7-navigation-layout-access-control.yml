nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RBAC properly enforced via Spatie Permission middleware. Role-based navigation uses frontend conditionals for UX, but backend middleware enforces security. 403 error handling properly configured. User data loading via middleware secure. No XSS vulnerabilities (React escapes by default). Comprehensive RBAC tests validate 403 responses for non-admin users.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Eager loading of roles and office relationships on every request adds minimal overhead (2 additional queries). User data cached in Inertia page props. Navigation rendering is client-side (fast). Inertia progress indicator provides UX feedback. Build output shows reasonable bundle sizes (AuthenticatedLayout 11.34 kB). No N+1 query concerns.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive test coverage ensures correctness. Null-safe checks for optional user.roles and user.office properties prevent runtime errors. 403 error page provides graceful degradation. All 99 tests pass (100% success rate). TypeScript type safety prevents type-related bugs.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization and pattern consistency. Helper functions (hasRole, hasAnyRole) promote DRY principles. Self-documenting component structure. Follows established Laravel/React/Inertia conventions. TypeScript interfaces properly typed. Mobile and desktop navigation follow same patterns.'

architectural_notes:
  - Proper separation of concerns: Frontend conditionals for UX, backend middleware for security
  - User data loading via Inertia middleware follows established pattern from Story 1.3
  - 403 error handling configured at application level in bootstrap/app.php
  - TypeScript interfaces properly extend existing User type with optional relationships
  - Navigation component follows Laravel Breeze patterns with role-based enhancements
  - Bell icon placeholder properly documented as non-functional (Epic 4 will add functionality)

recommendations:
  immediate: [] # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: 'Add active state highlighting for Admin dropdown when on admin routes'
      refs: ['AuthenticatedLayout.tsx:52-100']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Currently Admin dropdown does not show active state when user is on /admin/* routes. Minor UX enhancement for better navigation feedback.'
    - action: 'Consider extracting navigation config to separate file'
      refs: ['AuthenticatedLayout.tsx navigation structure']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'As navigation grows in Epic 2+ (Procurements, Transactions, Announcements), centralized config would improve maintainability.'
    - action: 'Add E2E tests for navigation flow when full workflows available'
      refs: ['Epic 2+ consideration']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Feature tests provide good coverage. E2E tests valuable for integrated navigation workflows across multiple pages.'

security_analysis:
  authentication: 'All routes properly protected with auth middleware'
  authorization: 'Role-based access control enforced via Spatie Permission middleware'
  data_exposure: 'User data (roles, office) appropriately shared via Inertia props - no sensitive data leaked'
  error_handling: 'Custom 403 page prevents information disclosure, provides user-friendly error message'
  frontend_security: 'Role checks in React are for UX only - security enforced on backend'

performance_metrics:
  bundle_size: 'AuthenticatedLayout: 11.34 kB (3.14 kB gzipped) - acceptable overhead'
  test_execution: '10 navigation tests in 0.42s - fast feedback loop'
  build_time: 'TypeScript compilation + Vite build in ~2s - excellent DX'

code_quality_highlights:
  - Clean TypeScript integration with proper type imports
  - Null-safe optional chaining for user.roles and user.office
  - Consistent helper function pattern (hasRole, hasAnyRole)
  - Self-documenting component structure
  - Excellent test naming conventions (Given-When-Then implied)
  - Mobile-responsive navigation mirrors desktop patterns
