# Quality Gate Decision
# Story 2.2: Reference Number Generation Service

schema: 1
story: '2.2'
story_title: 'Reference Number Generation Service'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Lock timeout requirement (AC#6) not enforced at 5 seconds and concurrency validation (AC#11) exercised sequentially; both need remediation before PASS.'
reviewer: 'Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)'
updated: '2025-10-31T00:00:00Z'

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: 'RN-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Service retries transactions but never aborts at the mandated 5-second lock timeout, deferring to database defaults.'
    suggested_action: 'Add explicit timing/lock fail handling so `ReferenceNumberException` is raised after ~5 seconds of contention.'
  - id: 'RN-002'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Integration test loops sequentially, so the “100 concurrent requests” acceptance criterion is not validated.'
    suggested_action: 'Rework the feature test to trigger simultaneous generation (jobs/parallel testing) and confirm unique outputs.'
