# Story 2.3: Procurement CRUD Operations

**Status**: Done  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Procurement & Transaction Lifecycle  
**Story Statement**: As an Endorser or Administrator, I want to create, view, edit, and manage procurements, so that I can initiate and track procurement requests.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Procurement Eloquent model created with fillable fields: `end_user_id`, `particular_id`, `purpose`, `abc_amount`, `date_of_entry`, `status`, `created_by_user_id`
2. Procurement model implements SoftDeletes trait
3. Procurement model defines relationships: `belongsTo` Office (end_user), `belongsTo` Particular, `belongsTo` User (created_by), `hasOne` PurchaseRequest (through Transaction), `hasOne` PurchaseOrder (through Transaction), `hasOne` Voucher (through Transaction), `hasMany` ProcurementStatusHistory
4. All authenticated users (Viewer, Endorser, Administrator) can access Procurements list page at `/procurements`
5. Procurements page displays table showing: Procurement ID, End User Office, Particular, Purpose (truncated to 100 chars), ABC Amount (formatted currency ₱#,###.##), Date of Entry, Status, Created By, Created Date
6. Endorser and Administrator can create new procurement via `/procurements/create` with form fields: End User (dropdown from active offices), Particular (dropdown from active particulars), Purpose (textarea, required, max 1000 chars), ABC Amount (currency input, required, min 0.01), Date of Entry (date picker, required, defaults to today)
7. Form validation: all required fields must be filled; ABC Amount must be positive decimal with max 2 decimal places; Date of Entry cannot be future date
8. On successful creation, procurement created with `status='Created'` and `created_by_user_id=current user`; user redirected to procurement detail page
9. Endorser and Administrator can edit existing procurement via `/procurements/{id}/edit`
10. Edit restrictions: If procurement has transactions (PR, PO, or VCH exists), only `purpose`, `abc_amount`, and `date_of_entry` fields editable; `end_user_id` and `particular_id` become read-only with tooltip “Cannot change End User/Particular after transactions created”
11. Procurement list includes pagination (50 per page), search/filter by: End User Office (dropdown), Particular (dropdown), Status (dropdown), Date Range (from/to date pickers), Created By (current user checkbox “My Procurements”)
12. Procurement list sortable by: ID, End User Office, ABC Amount, Date of Entry, Created Date (click column headers; default sort: Created Date DESC)
13. RBAC enforced: All roles can view procurement list and details; Endorser and Administrator can create/edit/delete; Viewer sees read-only view with no action buttons
14. Success/error toast notifications displayed using Shadcn/UI Toast component
15. TypeScript interface defined for Procurement type matching Eloquent model in `resources/js/types/models.ts`
16. Soft delete available for procurements without transactions; if transactions exist, show warning modal “Cannot delete procurement with existing transactions. Archive instead?” with Archive button that soft-deletes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1 delivered the procurements table, transaction tables, and status history structure that CRUD operations must use, including enum values and foreign key constraints.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.1.database-schema-procurements-transactions.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.2 provides the reference number service used by downstream transaction creation; procurement creation should prepare data for later transaction calls but does not assign reference numbers itself.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.2.reference-number-generation-service.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- Procurement entity fields, relationships, and status enums are defined for both backend (Eloquent) and frontend (TypeScript).  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#procurement]
- Transaction model relationships (PR/PO/VCH) clarify how linked records surface in procurement detail views.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction-base-interface]
- Status history structure (`ProcurementStatusHistory`) guides the `hasMany` relationship requirements.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#procurement]

### Service & Application Layer
- Controllers live under `app/Http/Controllers`, Form Requests under `app/Http/Requests`, and services under `app/Services` in the established application layering.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]
- RBAC leverages Laravel Breeze auth with Spatie Permission for role enforcement.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Frontend Architecture
- React + Inertia pages reside in `resources/js/Pages`, with components reused from `resources/js/Components`; Shadcn/UI is the standardized component library for tables, forms, and toasts.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]

### Technical Constraints
- The stack mandates Laravel 12.x, React 19 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL 8.0+, ensuring compatibility with existing tooling.  
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#definitive-technology-choices]
- Monetary values should continue using decimal(15,2) semantics established in Epic 1, matching database precision.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.1.database-schema-procurements-transactions.md#field-specific-notes]

### Testing Requirements
- No dedicated testing-strategy document exists in architecture; follow Laravel conventions with unit/feature tests that cover validation, RBAC, and UI behaviors implied by ACs.  
  [Source: architecture/index.md#table-of-contents]

### Project Structure Notes
- Backend code additions must adhere to the monorepo directories cited above; frontend assets should align with existing Admin/Procurements pages under `resources/js/Pages`.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]
- No additional structure conflicts identified.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story 2.3 implements a comprehensive CRUD system for procurements with excellent adherence to architectural patterns and acceptance criteria. The implementation demonstrates:

- **Clean Architecture**: Thin controllers, proper use of Form Requests for validation, and appropriate model relationships
- **RBAC Enforcement**: Middleware-based authorization with proper role checks at both controller and form request levels
- **Transaction-aware Logic**: Smart field locking when transactions exist prevents data integrity issues
- **Frontend Excellence**: Type-safe React components with Inertia, comprehensive filter/search/sort capabilities
- **Test Coverage**: 5 focused feature tests covering critical RBAC, CRUD, and business rule scenarios

All 16 acceptance criteria are fully met with appropriate test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

**Critical: Coding Standards Compliance**

- **Files Modified**: `app/Models/Procurement.php`, `app/Models/Transaction.php`, `app/Models/PurchaseRequest.php`, `app/Models/PurchaseOrder.php`, `app/Models/Voucher.php`, `app/Models/ProcurementStatusHistory.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/ProcurementController.php`, `app/Http/Requests/StoreProcurementRequest.php`, `app/Http/Requests/UpdateProcurementRequest.php`, `tests/Feature/ProcurementControllerTest.php`, `database/factories/OfficeFactory.php`, `database/factories/ParticularFactory.php`, `database/factories/ProcurementFactory.php`
  - **Change**: Added `declare(strict_types=1);` to all new PHP files
  - **Why**: Coding standards require PHP 8.2+ strict typing declaration for all new files
  - **How**: Inserted declaration after opening PHP tag, before namespace declaration; verified all 125 tests still pass

- **File**: `app/Models/Procurement.php`
  - **Change**: Fixed PSR-12 formatting (class_attributes_separation, single_blank_line_at_eof)
  - **Why**: Laravel Pint detected style violations that would block commits
  - **How**: Ran `./vendor/bin/pint` to auto-fix formatting issues

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Fixed** - strict_types added, Pint formatting applied
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in `app/Models`, `app/Http/Controllers`, `app/Http/Requests`, `resources/js/Pages/Procurements`
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Laravel feature tests cover RBAC, validation, business rules
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 16 acceptance criteria validated through code review and test execution

### Improvements Checklist

All critical issues have been addressed:

- [x] Added missing `declare(strict_types=1);` to 13 new PHP files
- [x] Fixed PSR-12 formatting issues in Procurement model
- [x] Verified all 125 tests pass after refactoring

No developer action required.

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns identified:

- ✓ RBAC properly enforced via middleware and Form Request authorization
- ✓ Form validation prevents SQL injection (using Eloquent ORM)
- ✓ Mass assignment protection via `$fillable` array
- ✓ Soft deletes used (no hard deletes of audit-critical data)
- ✓ CSRF protection inherited from Laravel Breeze
- ✓ No sensitive data exposure in frontend props

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Optimized for expected load:

- ✓ Eager loading with `with()` prevents N+1 queries (lines 36-40, 128-136, 148)
- ✓ Pagination at 50 items per page (line 78)
- ✓ Indexed foreign keys from migration (end_user_id, particular_id, created_by_user_id)
- ✓ `withQueryString()` preserves filters across pagination
- ✓ Database queries properly scoped by filters
