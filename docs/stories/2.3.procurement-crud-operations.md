# Story 2.3: Procurement CRUD Operations

**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Procurement & Transaction Lifecycle  
**Story Statement**: As an Endorser or Administrator, I want to create, view, edit, and manage procurements, so that I can initiate and track procurement requests.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Procurement Eloquent model created with fillable fields: `end_user_id`, `particular_id`, `purpose`, `abc_amount`, `date_of_entry`, `status`, `created_by_user_id`
2. Procurement model implements SoftDeletes trait
3. Procurement model defines relationships: `belongsTo` Office (end_user), `belongsTo` Particular, `belongsTo` User (created_by), `hasOne` PurchaseRequest (through Transaction), `hasOne` PurchaseOrder (through Transaction), `hasOne` Voucher (through Transaction), `hasMany` ProcurementStatusHistory
4. All authenticated users (Viewer, Endorser, Administrator) can access Procurements list page at `/procurements`
5. Procurements page displays table showing: Procurement ID, End User Office, Particular, Purpose (truncated to 100 chars), ABC Amount (formatted currency ₱#,###.##), Date of Entry, Status, Created By, Created Date
6. Endorser and Administrator can create new procurement via `/procurements/create` with form fields: End User (dropdown from active offices), Particular (dropdown from active particulars), Purpose (textarea, required, max 1000 chars), ABC Amount (currency input, required, min 0.01), Date of Entry (date picker, required, defaults to today)
7. Form validation: all required fields must be filled; ABC Amount must be positive decimal with max 2 decimal places; Date of Entry cannot be future date
8. On successful creation, procurement created with `status='Created'` and `created_by_user_id=current user`; user redirected to procurement detail page
9. Endorser and Administrator can edit existing procurement via `/procurements/{id}/edit`
10. Edit restrictions: If procurement has transactions (PR, PO, or VCH exists), only `purpose`, `abc_amount`, and `date_of_entry` fields editable; `end_user_id` and `particular_id` become read-only with tooltip “Cannot change End User/Particular after transactions created”
11. Procurement list includes pagination (50 per page), search/filter by: End User Office (dropdown), Particular (dropdown), Status (dropdown), Date Range (from/to date pickers), Created By (current user checkbox “My Procurements”)
12. Procurement list sortable by: ID, End User Office, ABC Amount, Date of Entry, Created Date (click column headers; default sort: Created Date DESC)
13. RBAC enforced: All roles can view procurement list and details; Endorser and Administrator can create/edit/delete; Viewer sees read-only view with no action buttons
14. Success/error toast notifications displayed using Shadcn/UI Toast component
15. TypeScript interface defined for Procurement type matching Eloquent model in `resources/js/types/models.ts`
16. Soft delete available for procurements without transactions; if transactions exist, show warning modal “Cannot delete procurement with existing transactions. Archive instead?” with Archive button that soft-deletes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1 delivered the procurements table, transaction tables, and status history structure that CRUD operations must use, including enum values and foreign key constraints.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.1.database-schema-procurements-transactions.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.2 provides the reference number service used by downstream transaction creation; procurement creation should prepare data for later transaction calls but does not assign reference numbers itself.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.2.reference-number-generation-service.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- Procurement entity fields, relationships, and status enums are defined for both backend (Eloquent) and frontend (TypeScript).  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#procurement]
- Transaction model relationships (PR/PO/VCH) clarify how linked records surface in procurement detail views.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction-base-interface]
- Status history structure (`ProcurementStatusHistory`) guides the `hasMany` relationship requirements.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#procurement]

### Service & Application Layer
- Controllers live under `app/Http/Controllers`, Form Requests under `app/Http/Requests`, and services under `app/Services` in the established application layering.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]
- RBAC leverages Laravel Breeze auth with Spatie Permission for role enforcement.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Frontend Architecture
- React + Inertia pages reside in `resources/js/Pages`, with components reused from `resources/js/Components`; Shadcn/UI is the standardized component library for tables, forms, and toasts.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]

### Technical Constraints
- The stack mandates Laravel 12.x, React 19 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL 8.0+, ensuring compatibility with existing tooling.  
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#definitive-technology-choices]
- Monetary values should continue using decimal(15,2) semantics established in Epic 1, matching database precision.  
  [Source: docs/stories/2.1.database-schema-procurements-transactions.md#field-specific-notes]

### Testing Requirements
- No dedicated testing-strategy document exists in architecture; follow Laravel conventions with unit/feature tests that cover validation, RBAC, and UI behaviors implied by ACs.  
  [Source: architecture/index.md#table-of-contents]

### Project Structure Notes
- Backend code additions must adhere to the monorepo directories cited above; frontend assets should align with existing Admin/Procurements pages under `resources/js/Pages`.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure-monorepo]
- No additional structure conflicts identified.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1 (AC: 1-3,16) — Implement Procurement Model Enhancements
- [x] Create `app/Models/Procurement.php` with fillable fields, SoftDeletes, status constants, and relationships to offices, particulars, users, transactions, and status history.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#procurement]
- [x] Introduce supporting models (`Transaction`, `PurchaseRequest`, `PurchaseOrder`, `Voucher`, `ProcurementStatusHistory`) to satisfy relationship definitions.  
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Task 2 (AC: 4-13,16) — Build Procurement Controller & Routes
- [x] Register authenticated routes in `routes/web.php` with role middleware for mutating actions.  
  [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
- [x] Implement controller actions using Form Requests for validation plus eager loading, filtering, pagination, and soft-delete handling.  
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#definitive-technology-choices]

### Task 3 (AC: 5-15) — Frontend Pages & Components

  [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-procurement-transaction-lifecycle.md:58]
- [x] Provide client filters (status, office, particular, date range, “My Procurements”) and wiring to Inertia router; surface flash messages via toast notifications.  
  [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

### Task 5 (AC: 10-11,16) — Transaction-aware Edit/Delete Constraints
- [x] Detect linked transactions to lock End User/Particular fields and adjust archive messaging before soft delete.
