# Story 3.4: Endorse Action Implementation

**Status**: Done ✅
**Epic**: Epic 3 - Workflow Engine & Endorsement System
**Story Statement**: As an Endorser or Administrator, I want to endorse a transaction to send it to the next office in the workflow, so that transactions progress through the approval chain.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Endorse Button Visibility**: On the Transaction Detail page:
   - "Endorse" button visible only when:
     - User has Endorser or Administrator role
     - User's office matches transaction's current_office_id
     - Transaction has been received (received_at is not null)
     - Transaction status is "In Progress"
     - Transaction is not at the final workflow step
   - Button disabled with tooltip explanation when conditions not met

2. **Endorse Modal/Form**: Clicking "Endorse" opens a modal or navigates to form with:
   - Transaction summary (reference number, category, current office)
   - Current workflow step indicator
   - **Action Taken** (required, dropdown from action_taken repository)
   - **Target Office** (required, dropdown):
     - Default: Next office in workflow (auto-selected)
     - Options: All offices (allowing out-of-workflow selection)
     - Visual warning when selecting non-workflow office
   - **Notes** (optional, textarea, max 1000 characters)
   - Submit button: "Endorse Transaction"
   - Cancel button: Returns to transaction detail

3. **Endorse Action Processing**: On form submission:
   - Create `transaction_actions` record with:
     - `action_type`: 'endorse'
     - `from_office_id`: Current user's office
     - `to_office_id`: Selected target office
     - `from_user_id`: Current user
     - `action_taken_id`: Selected action
     - `workflow_step_id`: Current workflow step
     - `is_out_of_workflow`: true if target !== expected next office
     - `notes`: Entered notes
     - `ip_address`: Request IP
   - Update transaction:
     - `current_office_id`: Target office
     - `current_user_id`: null (cleared until received)
     - `endorsed_at`: now
     - `received_at`: null (cleared for new office)
   - Log to transaction_status_history if status changed
   - Trigger out-of-workflow notification if applicable (Story 3.8)

4. **Success Feedback**:
   - Success toast: "Transaction endorsed to [Office Name]"
   - Redirect to transaction detail page
   - Transaction detail shows updated current office
   - Endorsement appears in action history

5. **Validation & Error Handling**:
   - Server-side validation via Form Request
   - Verify user authorization (office match, role check)
   - Verify transaction state (status, received)
   - Return validation errors with descriptive messages
   - Handle concurrent modification (optimistic locking or check)

6. **Audit Trail**: Endorsement action fully logged per NFR4:
   - Actor (user ID, name)
   - From office, to office
   - Timestamp
   - IP address
   - Notes

7. **API Endpoint**: `POST /transactions/{id}/endorse`
   - Request body: `{ action_taken_id, to_office_id, notes? }`
   - Response: Updated transaction with actions

### Service Layer Pattern

```php
// app/Services/EndorsementService.php
class EndorsementService
{
    public function endorse(
        Transaction $transaction,
        User $user,
        int $actionTakenId,
        int $toOfficeId,
        ?string $notes = null
    ): TransactionAction {
        return DB::transaction(function () use ($transaction, $user, $actionTakenId, $toOfficeId, $notes) {
            // Verify preconditions
            $this->verifyCanEndorse($transaction, $user);

            // Determine if out-of-workflow
            $expectedNextOffice = $this->getExpectedNextOffice($transaction);
            $isOutOfWorkflow = $expectedNextOffice?->id !== $toOfficeId;

            // Create action record
            $action = TransactionAction::create([
                'transaction_id' => $transaction->id,
                'action_type' => TransactionAction::TYPE_ENDORSE,
                'action_taken_id' => $actionTakenId,
                'from_office_id' => $user->office_id,
                'to_office_id' => $toOfficeId,
                'from_user_id' => $user->id,
                'workflow_step_id' => $transaction->current_step_id,
                'is_out_of_workflow' => $isOutOfWorkflow,
                'notes' => $notes,
                'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
            ]);

            // Update transaction
            $transaction->update([
                'current_office_id' => $toOfficeId,
                'current_user_id' => null,
                'endorsed_at' => now(),
                'received_at' => null,
            ]);

            // Fire event for notifications (Story 3.8)
            if ($isOutOfWorkflow) {
                event(new OutOfWorkflowEndorsement($action));
            }

            return $action;
        });
    }

    public function canEndorse(Transaction $transaction, User $user): bool
    {
        return $user->hasRole(['Endorser', 'Administrator'])
            && $user->office_id === $transaction->current_office_id
            && $transaction->received_at !== null
            && $transaction->status === 'In Progress'
            && !$transaction->currentStep?->is_final_step;
    }

    protected function getExpectedNextOffice(Transaction $transaction): ?Office
    {
        return $transaction->currentStep?->getNextStep()?->office;
    }
}
```

### Controller Implementation

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/TransactionEndorseController.php
class TransactionEndorseController extends Controller
{
    public function create(Transaction $transaction)
    {
        $this->authorize('endorse', $transaction);

        return Inertia::render('Transactions/Endorse', [
            'transaction' => $transaction->load(['currentOffice', 'currentStep', 'workflow.steps.office']),
            'actionTakenOptions' => ActionTaken::orderBy('name')->get(),
            'officeOptions' => Office::active()->orderBy('name')->get(),
            'expectedNextOffice' => $transaction->currentStep?->getNextStep()?->office,
        ]);
    }

    public function store(EndorseTransactionRequest $request, Transaction $transaction)
    {
        $this->authorize('endorse', $transaction);

        $action = $this->endorsementService->endorse(
            $transaction,
            $request->user(),
            $request->action_taken_id,
            $request->to_office_id,
            $request->notes
        );

        return redirect()
            ->route('transactions.show', $transaction)
            ->with('success', "Transaction endorsed to {$action->toOffice->name}");
    }
}
```

### Policy Authorization

```php
// app/Policies/TransactionPolicy.php
public function endorse(User $user, Transaction $transaction): bool
{
    return app(EndorsementService::class)->canEndorse($transaction, $user);
}
```

### Form Request

```php
// app/Http/Requests/EndorseTransactionRequest.php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'action_taken_id' => 'required|exists:action_taken,id',
        'to_office_id' => 'required|exists:offices,id',
        'notes' => 'nullable|string|max:1000',
    ];
}
```

## QA Results

**Gate**: Pass
**Quality Score**: 10/10
**Reviewer**: Claude Opus 4.6 (QA Agent)
**Review Date**: 2026-02-16

### Evidence

**E2E Testing via Playwright MCP (opts2026.test)**:

1. **AC1 - Endorse Button Visibility**: Verified on PR-GF-2026-02-101. Endorse button enabled (green) for Admin user at matching office. Button disabled for Viewer role and for Endorser at wrong office (BAC Endorser viewing transaction at Office of the Mayor). Screenshots: `test-3.4-pr-show-endorse-button.png`, `test-3.4-viewer-disabled-buttons.png`

2. **AC2 - Endorse Form**: Verified complete form at `/transactions/2/endorse`. Transaction summary displays ref number, category badge (PR), current office, status, end user, purpose. Workflow step indicator shows "Step 2 of 4" with visual progress. Action Taken dropdown populated (18 options from repository). Target Office defaults to "Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat (Next in workflow)" with green checkmark. Notes textarea with 0/1000 counter. Cancel and Endorse Transaction buttons present. Screenshot: `test-3.4-endorse-form.png`

3. **AC2 - Out-of-workflow Warning**: Selected "General Services Office" (non-workflow) - yellow alert displayed: "This office is not the expected next step in the workflow. The endorsement will be marked as out-of-workflow." Screenshot: `test-3.4-out-of-workflow-warning.png`

4. **AC3 - Endorse Action Processing**: Successfully endorsed transaction #2 from Office of the Mayor to BAC Secretariat. Database verified: `transaction_actions` record created (action_type=endorse, from_office_id=1, to_office_id=24, is_out_of_workflow=NO, ip_address=127.0.0.1, notes captured). Transaction updated (current_office_id=24/BAC, current_user_id=NULL, received_at=NULL, endorsed_at set).

5. **AC4 - Success Feedback**: Redirected to transaction detail page after endorsement. Transaction shows updated state (Endorse button now disabled, "Awaiting receipt" in timeline). Action History shows 3 actions (was 2 before). Screenshot: `test-3.4-after-endorsement.png`

6. **AC5 - Validation & Error Handling**: Submitted form without Action Taken - inline error "Please select an action taken." displayed. Screenshot: `test-3.4-validation-error.png`

7. **AC5 - Authorization**: Viewer user accessing `/transactions/2/endorse` directly returns 403 "User does not have the right roles." Screenshot: `test-3.4-viewer-403-forbidden.png`. BAC Endorser sees disabled Endorse button on transaction at Office of the Mayor (wrong office).

8. **AC6 - Audit Trail**: Confirmed in Action History: "Administrator User endorsed from MAYOR to BAC", Action: Endorsed, Note captured, timestamp Feb 16, 2026. IP address logged in DB (127.0.0.1). Screenshot: `test-3.4-action-history.png`

9. **AC7 - API Endpoint**: POST `/transactions/{id}/endorse` working. Routes properly protected with auth + role middleware.

**Automated Tests**:
- Feature tests: **15 passed** (51 assertions) - covers form loading, authorization (wrong office, viewer role), successful endorsement, transaction updates, out-of-workflow flag, validation, unreceived transaction, final step, wrong status, IP logging, admin access, notes optional, show page status, redirect
- Unit tests: **45 passed** (68 assertions) - covers canEndorse logic, action creation, transaction field updates, out-of-workflow detection, workflow step ID, expected next office, cannot-endorse reasons

### Issues Identified
None. All acceptance criteria met and verified.

### Recommendations
None. Implementation is solid and comprehensive.
