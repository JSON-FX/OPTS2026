# Story 1.4: Office Repository Management

## Status
Done

## Story

**As an** Administrator,
**I want** to manage the Office repository (create, read, update, delete offices),
**so that** I can maintain the organizational structure used in workflows and user assignments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Office Eloquent model created with fillable fields: name, type, abbreviation
2. Office model implements SoftDeletes trait
3. Admin can access Office Management page at `/admin/repositories/offices`
4. Office Management page displays table of all offices showing: name, type, abbreviation, created date
5. Admin can create new office with form fields: name (required, max 255), type (required, max 100), abbreviation (required, max 10)
6. Admin can edit existing office
7. Admin can delete office (soft delete, with warning if office is assigned to users or used in workflows)
8. Office list includes search/filter by name, type, abbreviation
9. Form validation prevents duplicate office names or abbreviations
10. Success/error toast notifications displayed
11. RBAC enforced: only Administrator role can access office repository management
12. TypeScript interface defined for Office type
13. Pagination implemented if office count exceeds 50 records
14. Sort capability on table columns (name, type, abbreviation, created date)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 (RBAC Implementation):
- Office model **already exists** at `app/Models/Office.php` with SoftDeletes trait
- Office model has fillable: `name`, `abbreviation`, `is_active` (boolean)
- **NOTE:** Current Office model does NOT have a `type` field - AC1 and AC5 require adding `type` field
- TypeScript Office interface **already exists** in `resources/js/types/models.ts` with fields: id, name, abbreviation, is_active, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
- **NOTE:** TypeScript Office interface does NOT have `type` field - needs to be added
- RBAC middleware pattern established: `middleware(['auth', 'role:Administrator'])`
- Form Request validation pattern established (StoreUserRequest, UpdateUserRequest)
- Controller pattern established: OfficeController should follow UserController.php pattern
- Inertia pages pattern: Index/Create/Edit components in `resources/js/Pages/Admin/{Resource}/`
- Routes pattern: `Route::resource('admin/repositories/offices', OfficeController::class)` with role:Administrator middleware
- TypeScript: Avoid using generic type parameters with `useForm` - let TypeScript infer types from initial values
- Flash messages: Use `->with('success', 'Message')` or `->with('error', 'Message')` pattern
- OfficeSeeder **already exists** with 25 LGU offices - new office management will allow admins to maintain this data

### Data Models

**Office Model (Existing - Needs Modification):**
```php
// app/Models/Office.php (Current implementation)
protected $fillable = [
    'name',
    'abbreviation',
    'is_active',
];
```

**Required Changes:**
- Add `type` field to Office migration and model fillable array
- Update OfficeSeeder to include `type` field for all 25 existing offices
- TypeScript Office interface needs `type: string` field added

**Relationships:**
- Office hasMany User (through `office_id` foreign key on users table)
- Office used as `end_user_id` FK in `procurements` table (future epics)
- Office used as `current_office_id` FK in `transactions` table (future epics)

### API Specifications

**Routes (to be created):**
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:Administrator'])->group(function () {
    Route::resource('admin/repositories/offices', OfficeController::class);
});
```

**Route Names:**
- `admin.repositories.offices.index` - GET /admin/repositories/offices
- `admin.repositories.offices.create` - GET /admin/repositories/offices/create
- `admin.repositories.offices.store` - POST /admin/repositories/offices
- `admin.repositories.offices.edit` - GET /admin/repositories/offices/{office}/edit
- `admin.repositories.offices.update` - PUT/PATCH /admin/repositories/offices/{office}
- `admin.repositories.offices.destroy` - DELETE /admin/repositories/offices/{office}

[Source: Established pattern from routes/web.php - UserController resource routes]

### Component Specifications

**Inertia Pages to Create:**
1. `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Repositories/Offices/Index.tsx`
   - Display paginated offices table
   - Include search/filter inputs (name, type, abbreviation)
   - Sort capability on columns
   - Create Office button
   - Edit/Delete action buttons per row
   - Delete confirmation dialog with warning if office has users

2. `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Repositories/Offices/Create.tsx`
   - Form with inputs: name, type, abbreviation, is_active
   - Client-side validation
   - Submit to `admin.repositories.offices.store`

3. `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Repositories/Offices/Edit.tsx`
   - Pre-populated form with existing office data
   - Update via `admin.repositories.offices.update`
   - Warning if office has assigned users

**Props Pattern:**
```typescript
interface IndexProps extends PageProps {
    offices: PaginatedData<Office>;
}

interface CreateProps extends PageProps {
    // No additional props needed
}

interface EditProps extends PageProps {
    office: Office;
    userCount: number; // Number of users assigned to this office
}
```

**Form Data Pattern:**
```typescript
// Let TypeScript infer types from initial values
const { data, setData, post, processing, errors } = useForm({
    name: '',
    type: '',
    abbreviation: '',
    is_active: true as boolean,
});
```

[Source: Established project structure from Story 1.3]

### Testing Requirements

**Feature Tests (OfficeControllerTest.php):**
1. `test_administrator_can_access_office_management()` - Admin gets 200 on /admin/repositories/offices
2. `test_viewer_cannot_access_office_management()` - Viewer gets 403
3. `test_endorser_cannot_access_office_management()` - Endorser gets 403
4. `test_can_create_office_with_valid_data()` - Office created successfully
5. `test_cannot_create_office_with_duplicate_name()` - Validation error on duplicate name
6. `test_cannot_create_office_with_duplicate_abbreviation()` - Validation error on duplicate abbreviation
7. `test_can_update_office()` - Office updated successfully
8. `test_can_delete_office()` - Office soft deleted successfully
9. `test_office_list_includes_pagination()` - Pagination works for 50+ records
10. `test_soft_deleted_offices_not_shown_in_list()` - Soft deleted offices excluded from index

**Testing Pattern:**
```php
use RefreshDatabase;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;

protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();
    Role::create(['name' => 'Administrator', 'guard_name' => 'web']);
    Role::create(['name' => 'Viewer', 'guard_name' => 'web']);
    Role::create(['name' => 'Endorser', 'guard_name' => 'web']);
}
```

[Source: tests/Feature/UserControllerTest.php pattern]

### Technical Constraints

**Validation Rules:**
- Name: required, string, max:255, unique:offices,name (ignore during update)
- Type: required, string, max:100
- Abbreviation: required, string, max:10, unique:offices,abbreviation (ignore during update)
- is_active: boolean, default true

**Soft Delete Behavior:**
- Use `$office->delete()` for soft delete
- Warn user if office has users assigned: "This office has {count} user(s) assigned. They will lose their office assignment."
- Show warning but allow deletion (users will have null office_id)
- Exclude soft-deleted offices from dropdowns using `Office::where('is_active', true)->whereNull('deleted_at')->get()`

**Performance Considerations:**
- Paginate at 50 records: `Office::paginate(50)`
- Add indexes on `name`, `abbreviation`, and `is_active` columns
- Consider eager loading users count for edit page: `$office->loadCount('users')`
