# Story 4.1.3: Dashboard SLA Performance Panel

**Status**: Draft
**Epic**: Epic 4.1 - Dashboard & Summary Views
**Story Statement**: As an Administrator or Endorser, I want to see SLA performance metrics on the dashboard, so that I can identify bottleneck offices and monitor workflow efficiency.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **SLA Performance Section**: Dashboard displays a "Performance" panel showing:
   - **Average Turnaround Time by Office**: For each office that handles transactions, show:
     - Office name
     - Average business days to process (from receive to next endorse/complete)
     - Expected days (from workflow step definition)
     - Performance indicator: green (avg <= expected), yellow (avg <= expected*1.5), red (avg > expected*1.5)
   - Only offices with completed actions in the last 30 days shown
   - Sortable by average turnaround or office name

2. **Out-of-Workflow Incident Summary**:
   - Current month count of out-of-workflow endorsements
   - Previous month count for comparison
   - Trend indicator (up/down arrow with percentage change)
   - Clicking count navigates to notification page filtered by `out_of_workflow`

3. **Transaction Volume Summary**:
   - Current month vs previous month transaction creation counts
   - Broken down by category (PR, PO, VCH)
   - Trend indicators per category
   - Visual: simple bar comparison or numeric with trend arrow

4. **Role-Based Visibility**:
   - **Administrator**: sees full performance data for all offices
   - **Endorser**: sees all offices but own office row highlighted
   - **Viewer**: sees performance data (read-only, no action links)

5. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Add to types:
   ```typescript
   interface OfficePerformance {
     office_id: number;
     office_name: string;
     office_abbreviation: string;
     avg_turnaround_days: number;
     expected_days: number;
     performance_rating: 'good' | 'warning' | 'poor';
     actions_count: number; // number of completed actions in period
   }

   interface IncidentSummary {
     current_month: number;
     previous_month: number;
     trend_percentage: number; // positive = increase, negative = decrease
   }

   interface VolumeSummary {
     category: TransactionCategory;
     current_month: number;
     previous_month: number;
     trend_percentage: number;
   }

   interface SlaPerformanceData {
     office_performance: OfficePerformance[];
     incidents: IncidentSummary;
     volume: VolumeSummary[];
   }
   ```

6. **Performance**: SLA calculations use efficient aggregate queries:
   - Use database-level `AVG()` and `COUNT()` with `GROUP BY`
   - Filter to last 30/60 days to keep queries fast
   - No N+1 loading patterns

7. **Dashboard Integration**: Panel fits into existing dashboard layout:
   - Positioned below the Activity Feed + Stagnant Panel row
   - Full-width section with sub-panels for Office Performance, Incidents, and Volume
   - Responsive: sub-panels stack vertically on mobile

  - [ ] Performance indicator: green/yellow/red badge or icon
  - [ ] Sortable columns
  - [ ] Highlight current user's office

- [ ] Task 7: Build Incident & Volume summary components (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `resources/js/Components/IncidentSummary.tsx` — current vs previous month with trend
  - [ ] Create `resources/js/Components/VolumeSummary.tsx` — per-category current vs previous with trends
  - [ ] Trend arrows: green down-arrow for incidents (fewer is better), category-neutral trend for volume
  - [ ] Clickable incident count → notification page

- [ ] Task 8: Integrate into Dashboard layout (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Add SLA performance section to `Dashboard.tsx`
  - [ ] Layout: 3 sub-panels in a grid (Office Performance table full-width, Incidents + Volume side by side)
  - [ ] Section heading: "Performance Metrics"
  - [ ] Responsive stacking

- [ ] Task 9: Write feature tests (AC: 1-4, 6)
  - [ ] Extend `tests/Feature/DashboardTest.php`

## Dev Notes

### Existing Source Files to Reference

- **DashboardController**: `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` (from Story 4.1.1)
- **DashboardService**: `app/Services/DashboardService.php` (from Story 4.1.1, extended in 4.1.2)

- **WorkflowStep model**: `app/Models/WorkflowStep.php` — `expected_days`, `office_id`, `step_order`
- **EtaCalculationService**: `app/Services/EtaCalculationService.php` — `businessDaysBetween()` for turnaround calculation

- **Out-of-workflow data**: `transaction_actions.is_out_of_workflow` column
- **Notification routes**: `/notifications?type=out_of_workflow` for incident drill-down link

### Average Turnaround Calculation

Turnaround per office = time between a `receive` action at that office and the subsequent `endorse` or `complete` action from that office.

```php
// Find pairs: receive_at_office → next_endorse_from_office
// Using transaction_actions:
// 1. Get 'receive' actions with to_office_id = office
// 2. For each, find the next 'endorse'/'complete' action with from_office_id = office on same transaction
// 3. Calculate business days between

// Efficient approach: use a subquery or self-join
$turnarounds = DB::table('transaction_actions as receive')
    ->join('transaction_actions as action', function ($join) {
        $join->on('receive.transaction_id', '=', 'action.transaction_id')
            ->where('action.id', '>', DB::raw('receive.id'))
            ->whereIn('action.action_type', ['endorse', 'complete']);
    })
    ->where('receive.action_type', 'receive')
    ->where('receive.created_at', '>=', now()->subDays(30))
    ->select(
        'receive.to_office_id as office_id',
        DB::raw('AVG(DATEDIFF(action.created_at, receive.created_at)) as avg_calendar_days'),
        DB::raw('COUNT(*) as actions_count')
    )
    ->groupBy('receive.to_office_id')
    ->get();
```

Note: This gives calendar days — to convert to business days, multiply by ~5/7 as approximation, or compute precisely for each pair.

### Performance Rating Logic

```php
$rating = match(true) {
    $avgDays <= $expectedDays => 'good',
    $avgDays <= $expectedDays * 1.5 => 'warning',
    default => 'poor',
};
```

### Month Boundary Queries

```php
$currentMonthStart = now()->startOfMonth();
$previousMonthStart = now()->subMonth()->startOfMonth();
$previousMonthEnd = now()->subMonth()->endOfMonth();
```

### Testing

- **Test file**: `tests/Feature/DashboardTest.php` (extend from 4.1.1 and 4.1.2)
- **Testing framework**: PHPUnit/Pest with `RefreshDatabase`
- **Key test data setup**:
  - Create transactions with actions at specific dates to produce known turnaround times
  - Create out-of-workflow actions in current and previous months for incident counts
  - Create transactions in both months for volume comparison
- **Assertion patterns**: Verify computed averages match expected values within tolerance
- **TypeScript**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify compile

### Dependencies

- **Story 4.1.1** must be completed first (DashboardController, DashboardService, Dashboard.tsx exist)
- **Story 4.1.2** should be completed first (dashboard layout with Activity Feed and Stagnant Panel established)
- **Story 3.8** (out-of-workflow data — already Done)
- **Story 3.9** (ETA calculations — already Done)
